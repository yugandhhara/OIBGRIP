      </br>
      <ul class="b">
        Dr Prakash Amte and his wife devoted their entire life for the betterment of the tribal people and local wildlife of the Gadchiroli region. They worked hard to bring awareness among the tribes people of the region, teaching them agricultural techniques and considerably reducing their dependence on hunting for survival. Absence of power did not deter them from performing several emergency surgical procedures and eventually they got a hospital fitted with modern facilities. Though the couple were not trained to be veterinarians; they went beyond the ordinary and created the ‘Animal Ark’ within their courtyard, providing a safe haven to deserted and injured animals.
        Dr Prakash Amte’s name easily ranks topmost among the popular persons of India. Dr Prakash Amte’s social work reached out to the masses through the biopic titled ‘Dr Prakash Baba Amte– The Real Hero’ which was released in Marathi, Hindi and English. The movie showcased his immeasurable contribution to society proving a source of inspiration to all of us. His immense work was recognized globally when he and his wife were awarded the Magsaysay Award for ‘Community Leadership’ in 2008. They were honored with several other awards too; however, this totally down-to-earth couple continue to carry on their good work in Hemalkasa without any fanfare
